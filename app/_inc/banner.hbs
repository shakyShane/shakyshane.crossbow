|  shakyShane.com - a static website/blog created using Crossbow.
|
|  Crossbow is a system for compiling static websites and blogs.
|  The Crossbow authors do not agree that the resulting markup from
|  a templating system or cms is 'irrelevant' - rather we see it as
|  an extremely important aspect of the development workflow and
|  have built Crossbow with this idea in mind.
