    <article ss-Post-Content>
        <p>The early adoption of my open source project <a href="http://browsersync.io">BrowserSync</a> has been <strong>really</strong> inspiring. The idea that people around the world are starting to use this little tool that I&#39;ve been hacking on in my spare time is mind-blowing.</p>
<p>As it becomes more popular, more bugs are reported - these are great &amp; have helped to make BrowserSync pretty stable at this point, (with the help of some awesome <a href="https://github.com/shakyShane/browser-sync/graphs/contributors">contributors</a>), but I&#39;ve been working soley on bugs for the last couple of months &amp; this has resulted in the delay of a killer feature that I believe will take BrowserSync to the next level - a <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="you-won-t-find-it-on-the-app-store">You won&#39;t find it on the App Store</h2>
<p>BrowserSync will remain a command-line tool. It will stay on NPM as a NodeJS module &amp; will always be free &amp; open-source (although if you do use it often and would like to <a href="https://github.com/shakyShane/browser-sync#support">support it</a>, please do.).</p>
<p>I built the tool <em>exactly</em> how I wanted to use it - from the command-line if needed, configurable to projects &amp; easy to integrate into existing workflows (that may include other gui tools, grunt, gulp etc) but now it&#39;s time to give it a user interface.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-will-work-">How it will work?</h3>
<p>The control panel will be a web page that is accessible whenever you run BrowserSync. The idea is that you&#39;ll have all your connected devices running on the proxy or server, and then a single browser window on your main computer will be used as the control panel. Simple as that.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-it-do-">What will it do?</h3>
<p>I have a short list of must-have features that will be available for launch. Things like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter a URL in the control panel &amp; all connected devices will navigate to it.</li>
<li>Keep a list of all visited links &amp; make it possible to return to any of them.</li>
<li>List the connected devices (with screen size?)</li>
<li>Toggle options (without having to restart BrowserSync)</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s all I have at the moment, &amp; now it&#39;s over to you....</p>
<h3 id="what-features-do-you-want-small-put-them-in-the-comments-small-">What features do you want? <small>(put them in the comments)</small></h3>
<p>If you could choose one feature (or many), what would it be? </p>
<p>Imagine having access to all of the connected devices when using BrowserSync - what would you want to do? I&#39;ve listed my top 4 features above, but I&#39;m curious what everyone else would want to do!</p>
<p>Comment below &amp; together let&#39;s make BrowserSync even better!</p>
